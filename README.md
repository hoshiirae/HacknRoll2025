# Meow: An Interactive Cat Adoption and Education Game

## Inspiration
The inspiration for **Meow** came from the desire to address two common problems: 
1. The lack of understanding about cat breeds and care among prospective pet owners.
2. High rates of shelter overcrowding.

We wanted to create an engaging and educational platform that not only informs but also promotes responsible pet ownership and adoption.

## What It Does
**Meow** is an interactive educational game where users play to help virtual cats escape by winning games like:
- **Guess the Breed**
- **Care Cat Quiz**
- **True or False**

If users win at least 2 out of 3 games, they unlock a compatibility quiz that matches them with a cat breed suited to their lifestyle. Finally, they gain access to an adoption page featuring cats of their matched breed, encouraging real-world adoptions.

## How We Built It
We built **Meow** using a combination of:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React
- **Design:** Figma for planning the UI and game flow
